# WishyWashy
WishyWashy is a gig app for back of house workers to fill positions when nobody on staff can cover it.

## Getting Started
A deployed version of the site can be found here https://edwardmara.github.io/WishyWashy/

## Usage
On the front page click the log in button that makes sense for you and either log in or register a new account and then log in.

### Manager
As a manager after you log in you will be greeted with screen that shows the current jobs you've posted and when you click on them you will see a list of workers that have applied to them with their contact information. If you wish to mark the position as filled then click on a worker in the list and it will no longer appear for workers to apply to. On the main dashboard there are also buttons to make a new job, just hit the button and fill in the boxes. and another button to delete a job, select the number of the job in the list and it will be deleted.

### Worker
As a worker after you log in you will be met with a job list with information about the jobs clicking on one will sign you up for it. Future version will have more feedback when a job is clicked and a profile to view your selected jobs.
